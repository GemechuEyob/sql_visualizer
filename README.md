difference between all the dialects and versions of sql

maintain a database to collect all info in the sql syntax, keywords and dialect version
- dialect table, their desc, and keywords, ddl/dml

install mysql server to store all keywords 

first dialect to try is snowflake, populate the mysql with snowflake keywords, right now just create a table to store the snowflake keywords.

create a simple app to take a sql query and identify the  keywords using the mysql setup

collect all snowflake keywords into a list and extract all keywords from a given query.
